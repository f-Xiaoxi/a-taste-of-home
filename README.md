# A Taste of Home

This is the first web application that our team created with [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com), in preparation for our [final project](https://github.com/barbayjuliette/take_trails).

The goal was to create a basic CRUD web app with Ruby on Rails, to get familiarized with working as a team and bring together all the knowledge acquired throughout the previous weeks.

We created a digital marketplace for home-cooked meals. Users can buy and sell prepared meals, and browse for their favorite dishes.

As a seller, I can see my listed meals and I can manage my orders.
